## Summary

Dueling with Dad Jokes is a web app which provides users a fun and lighthearted experience with friends through playing a game where they face-off by telling terrible dad jokes to each other and try not to laugh. 

More detailed instructions for how to play can be found on the [home page](https://caleb-king.github.io/dueling-with-dad-jokes/index.html) of the app. There you will also find a video example of two dads facing off.

I am using the icanhazdadjoke.com API for my joke database to provide random jokes during gameplay. I am also using this API in my Find Jokes feature.
